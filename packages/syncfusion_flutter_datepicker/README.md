## Installation

Install the latest version from [pub]().

## Getting started

Import the following package.

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_datepicker/datepicker.dart';
```

### Add date range picker to the widget tree

Add the SfDateRangePicker widget as a child of any widget. Here, the SfDateRangePicker widget is added as a child of the scaffold widget.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      body: Container(
    child: SfDateRangePicker(),
  ));
}
```

### Change different views

The SfDateRangePicker widget provides four different types of views to display. It can be assigned to the widget constructor by using the view property. Default view of the widget is month view. By default the current date will be displayed initially for all the date range picker views.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      body: SfDateRangePicker(
    view: DateRangePickerView.year,
  ));
}
```

### Change first day of week

The DateRangePicker widget will be rendered with Sunday as the first day of the week, but you can customize it to any day by using the `firstDayOfWeek` property.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	return Scaffold(
		body: SfDateRangePicker(
      view: DateRangePickerView.month,
      monthViewSettings: DateRangePickerMonthViewSettings(firstDayOfWeek: 1),
    ));
}
```

### Date selection

The DateRangePicker supports selecting single, multiple, and range of dates. It also supports programmatic selection.

The selected date or range details can be obtained using the `onSelectionChanged` callback of date range picker. The callback will return the `DateRangePickerSelectionChangedArgs` which contains the selected date or range details.

```dart
void _onSelectionChanged(DateRangePickerSelectionChangedArgs args) {
  // TODO: implement your code here
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      body: Container(
        child: SfDateRangePicker(
          onSelectionChanged: _onSelectionChanged,
          selectionMode: DateRangePickerSelectionMode.range,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```
