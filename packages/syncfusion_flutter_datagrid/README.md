## DataGrid features

**Column types** - Support to load any widget in a each column.

![Flutter DataGrid shows different column types](https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/Flutter/pub_images/flutter-datagrid-column-types.png)

**Editing** - Allows users to edit cell values. An editor widget can be loaded based on the column type to edit cell values.

**Column sizing** - Set the width of columns with various sizing options. Fit the columns based on the value of the cells to improve readability.

**Row height** - Set the height for header and data rows. Fit the rows based on the value of the cells to improve readability. Also, set the different height for specific rows.

**Sorting** - Sort one or more columns in the ascending or descending order. 

![Columns are sorted in flutter datagrid](https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/Flutter/pub_images/flutter-datagrid-sorting.gif)

**Selection** - Select one or more rows. Keyboard navigation is supported for web platforms. Built-in checkbox columns allow display of a checkbox in each row to select entire rows when the boxes are checked. Users can also select or deselect all the rows by selecting the checkbox in the header.

**Paging** - Load data in segments. It is useful when loading huge amounts of data.

![Flutter DataGrid shows rows in page segments](https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/Flutter/pub_images/flutter-datagrid-paging.png)

**Footer** - Show an additional row that can be displayed below to last row. Widgets can also be displayed in the footer row.

![Footer view in Flutter DataGrid](https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/Flutter/pub_images/flutter-datagrid-footer-view.png)

**Freeze Panes** - Freeze the rows and columns when scrolling the grid. 

![First row and column are frozen in flutter datagrid](https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/Flutter/pub_images/flutter-datagrid-freeze-panes.gif)

**Swiping** - Swipe a row right to left or left to right for custom actions such as deleting, editing, and so on. When the user swipes a row, the row will be moved and the swipe view will show the custom actions.

**Pull to refresh** - Allows users to refresh data when the DataGrid is pulled down.

**Exporting** - Export the DataGrid content, such as rows, stacked header rows, and table summary rows, to Excel and PDF format with several customization options.

**Theme** - Use a dark or light theme.

**Accessibility** - The DataGrid can easily be accessed by screen readers.

**Right to Left (RTL)** - Right-to-left direction support for users working in RTL languages like Hebrew and Arabic.

## Installation

Install the latest version from [pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/syncfusion_flutter_datagrid#-installing-tab-).

## Getting started

Import the following package.

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_datagrid/datagrid.dart';
```
### Creating Data for an application

The SfDataGrid is dependent upon data. Create a simple data source for `SfDataGrid` as shown in the following code example.

```dart
class Employee {
  Employee(this.id, this.name, this.designation, this.salary);
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final String designation;
  final int salary;
}
```

Create the collection of employee data with the required number of data objects. Here, the method used to populate the data objects is initialized in initState()

`DataGridSource` objects are expected to be long-lived, not re-created with each build.

```dart
List<Employee> employees = <Employee>[];

late EmployeeDataSource employeeDataSource;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  employees= getEmployees();
  employeeDataSource = EmployeeDataSource(employees: employees);
}

 List<Employee> getEmployees() {
  return[
  Employee(10001, 'James', 'Project Lead', 20000),
  Employee(10002, 'Kathryn', 'Manager', 30000),
  Employee(10003, 'Lara', 'Developer', 15000),
  Employee(10004, 'Michael', 'Designer', 15000),
  Employee(10005, 'Martin', 'Developer', 15000),
  Employee(10006, 'Newberry', 'Developer', 15000),
  Employee(10007, 'Balnc', 'Developer', 15000),
  Employee(10008, 'Perry', 'Developer', 15000),
  Employee(10009, 'Gable', 'Developer', 15000),
  Employee(10010, 'Grimes', 'Developer', 15000)
  ];
}
```

### Creating DataSource for DataGrid

`DataGridSource` is used to obtain the row data for the `SfDataGrid`. So, create the data source from the DataGridSource and override the following APIs in it:

* `rows`: Fetches the rows available for data population. Also, it is used to fetch the corresponding data object to process the selection. This contains the collection of `DataGridRow` where each row contains the collection of `DataGridCell`. Each cell should have the cell value in `value` property. `value` is used to perform the sorting for columns.

* `buildRow`: Fetches the widget for each cell with `DataGridRowAdapter`.

```dart
class EmployeeDataSource extends DataGridSource {
  EmployeeDataSource({List<Employee> employees}) {
     _employees = employees
        .map<DataGridRow>((e) => DataGridRow(cells: [
              DataGridCell<int>(columnName: 'id', value: e.id),
              DataGridCell<String>(columnName: 'name', value: e.name),
              DataGridCell<String>(
                  columnName: 'designation', value: e.designation),
              DataGridCell<int>(columnName: 'salary', value: e.salary),
            ]))
        .toList();
  }

  List<DataGridRow>  _employees = [];

  @override
  List<DataGridRow> get rows =>  _employees;

  @override
  DataGridRowAdapter? buildRow(DataGridRow row) {
    return DataGridRowAdapter(
        cells: row.getCells().map<Widget>((dataGridCell) {
      return Container(
        alignment: (dataGridCell.columnName == 'id' || dataGridCell.columnName == 'salary')
            ? Alignment.centerRight
            : Alignment.centerLeft,
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Text(dataGridCell.value.toString()),
      );
    }).toList());
  }
}
```

Create an instance of `DataGridSource` and set this object to the `source` property of `SfDataGrid`.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Syncfusion DataGrid'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Expanded(
          child: SfDataGrid(
            source: _employeeDataSource,
          ),
        ),
      ));
}
```

### Defining columns

`SfDataGrid` supports load any widget in columns. You can add the column collection to the `columns` property.

```dart  
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: const Text('Syncfusion Flutter DataGrid'),
    ),
    body: SfDataGrid(
      source: employeeDataSource,
      columns: <GridColumn>[
        GridColumn(
            columnName: 'id',
            label: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                alignment: Alignment.centerRight,
                child: Text(
                  'ID',
                ))),
        GridColumn(
            columnName: 'name',
            label: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
                child: Text('Name'))),
        GridColumn(
            columnName: 'designation',
            width: 120,
            label: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
                child: Text('Designation'))),
        GridColumn(
            columnName: 'salary',
            label: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                alignment: Alignment.centerRight,
                child: Text('Salary'))),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```
