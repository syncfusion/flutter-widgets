## [21.1.39] - 04/11/2023

## Radial Gauge

**Bugs**
* #FB42660 - Now, the disposed exception is no longer thrown in the radial gauge when a pointer is updated dynamically.

## [20.4.52] - 02/28/2023

## Radial Gauge

**Bugs**
* #FB40920 - Now, the axis tapped callback returns the proper value while enabling the [`canScaleToFit`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/RadialAxis/canScaleToFit.html) property in gauges.

## [20.2.36] - 07/01/2022

## Radial Gauge

**Features**
* Now, the pointer focus will not get lost until the user interaction ends.

## [20.1.55] - 05/12/2022
**Bugs**
* Now, on setting the [`showLastLabel`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/RadialAxis/showLastLabel.html) property as `false`, the last label will not be visible in the [`SfRadialGauge`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/SfRadialGauge-class.html) widget. To make it visible, set the [`showLastLabel`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/RadialAxis/showLastLabel.html) property as `true`.

## [19.3.43] - 09/30/2021

## Linear Gauge

**Features**

* Pointer drag behavior - Provides an option to change the dragging behavior of the marker pointers. The available drag behaviors are `free` and `constraint`.
* Added `onChangeStart` and `onChangeEnd` callbacks in the [`LinearMarkerPointer`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/LinearMarkerPointer-class.html) to notify the user about the marker pointer start and end actions.

**Breaking changes**

* The `onValueChanged` callback has been renamed to `onChanged` in the [`LinearMarkerPointer`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/LinearMarkerPointer-class.html) class.

## Radial Gauge

**Enhancements**

* Now, the pointer can be freely dragged beyond the end-angle for circular radial gauge. For the non-circular radial gauge, the pointers can be dragged between the start and end angle only.
* The [`GaugeRange`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/GaugeRange/GaugeRange.html) will always apply in clockwise direction even the [`startValue`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/GaugeRange/startValue.html) is greater than the [`endValue`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/GaugeRange/endValue.html).
