/// Quick response code ([QRCode]) is a two-dimensional barcode. It can
/// efficiently store more information in a smaller space than 1D barcodes.
/// Each barcode can store values up to 7089 characters.
/// It is mostly used for URLs, business cards, contact information, etc.
///
/// The [QRCode] consists of a grid of dark and light dots or blocks that form
/// a square.
/// The data encoded in the barcode can be numeric, alphanumeric, or Shift
/// JIS characters.
///
/// * The QR Code uses version from 1 to 40. Version 1 measures 21 modules x 21
/// modules, version 2 measures 25 modules x 25 modules, and so on.
/// The number of modules increases in steps of 4 modules per side up to
/// version 40 that measures 177 modules x 177 modules.
/// * Each version has its own capacity. By default, the barcode control
/// automatically sets the version according to the length of the input text.
/// * The [QRCode] is designed for industrial uses and also commonly used
/// in consumer advertising.
///
/// The amount of data that can be stored in the [QRCode] symbol depends on the
/// [inputMode], [codeVersion] (1, ..., 40, indicating the overall dimensions
/// of the symbol, i.e. 4 Ã— version number + 17 dots on each side), and
/// [errorCorrectionLevel]. The maximum storage capacities occur for
/// [codeVersion] 40 and [ErrorCorrectionLevel.low].
